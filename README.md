# Fake-News-Detection-Model-using-Machine-Learning
built the Fake News Detection Model using Machine Learning part of Brainwave Matrix solution internship
 The dataset contains two sets of news: true news labeled as "1" and fake news labeled as "0." The model is trained using a TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert the text into numerical form and applies various classifiers like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. It achieves high accuracy in predicting whether a news article is true or fake by learning from the labeled dataset and recognizing patterns in the writing.
